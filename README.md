Module 10: Mini-Project | PokeAPI Integration Project

In this PokeAPI Integration project, I developed a web application that integrates with the PokeAPI, providing users with an immersive experience into the world of Pokémon. Leveraging HTML, Bootstrap, CSS, and JavaScript, I created a dynamic and interactive platform for exploring Pokémon data and information.

    - landing page with Bootstrap components and custom CSS styles
    - compatibility across various devices and screen sizes.
2. Pokémon Search Page - pokedex.html:
    - search page where users can enter a Pokémon's name or ID to retrieve relevant information.
    - fetch data from the PokeAPI and dynamically update the webpage content based on user input.
3. Pokémon Details Page- ultraPokedex.html:
    - details page that displays comprehensive information about a specific Pokémon, including its abilities, types, stats, and image.
    - Applied CSS styling to enhance the presentation of Pokémon details and ensure readability.
